# Recipe Recommender
An AI-driven project that recommends recipes based on user-input ingredients. Built using TensorFlow and Streamlit.

# Overview
This project uses deep learning techniques to suggest personalized recipes. By looking at the ingredients users enter, the system matches their taste with a wide range of recipes. Each recommended recipe comes from a neural network model trained on various aspects of recipes, like figuring out important details, outlining cooking steps, and listing ingredients. This makes sure users get recipes that fit their tastes and preferences perfectly.
